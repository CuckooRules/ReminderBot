# About

ReminderBot' (this project; pronounced "ReminderBot prime") is a fork of the jibble.org [ReminderBot](http://www.jibble.org/reminderbot/). ReminderBot' is based on [PircBot'](https://github.com/davidlazar/PircBot)

# Usage

Assuming PircBot' has been installed, ReminderBot' can be built by typing:

    $ ant

After editing `config.ini`, run ReminderBot' as follows:

    $ bin/reminderbot.sh config.ini

Once in IRC, ReminderBot' is activated by saying:

    <david> remind me in 40 minutes to pickup the laundry
    <ReminderBot> david: Okay, I'll remind you about that on Sat Feb 18 03:34:41 CST 2012
